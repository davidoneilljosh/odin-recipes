    <h4><em>Important and auspicious recipe to make during the Lantern Festival is Tang Yuan (汤圆), or Yuan Xiao (元宵). It’s a food that symbolizes harmony and reunion.</em></h4>

    <p>Yuan xiao, which is the name generally used in northern China, has a sweet and solid filling and is often served in a thick broth. Tang yuan, as it’s known in southern China, is usually stuffed with a soft filling (either sweet or savory) and served in a thinner soup.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>Roasted black sesame seeds</li> 
        <li>Sweet rice flour/glutinous flour</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Dark brown sugar or Chinese rock sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>

        <li>Grind the sesame seeds. Place roasted black sesame seeds in a food processor and process until finely ground. </li>
        <li>Form into balls and chill. Add butter, sugar, and salt to the ground sesame seeds and mix it with your hands until combined. Scoop out the mixture and roll each portion in a ball. Refrigerate to allow the flavors to meld and the filling to firm up. </li>
        <li>Make and shape the dough. Add warm water slowly to the dough, making sure the dough is not too wet. Scoop the dough out and roll each portion into a ball, dusting your hands with a little all-purpose flour to prevent sticking if needed. </li>
        <li>Fill the dough balls. Place the black sesame balls in the center and gently wrap and shape the dough around the filling until it is completely covered. </li>
        <li>Make the ginger syrup. Bring water to a boil, add ginger slices and sugar, and cook. Add tang yuan and stir immediately to prevent them from sticking. </li>

    </ol>
